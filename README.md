## 🌐 Overview

This project is a **Machine Learning-based system to detect ARP spoofing (poisoning) attacks**, simulating real-world network threats. It demonstrates how packet capture data can be used to train intelligent models that analyze network behavior, identify anomalies, and alert network defenders in real time.

🚀 **Languages & Tools**: Python 3, Scapy, TensorFlow, Keras  
🛡️ **Focus**: Network forensics, ARP spoofing, packet classification  
📘 **Use Case**: Academic research, cybersecurity education, and ML-based intrusion detection systems.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- ✅ Detect ARP spoofing attempts using supervised learning.
- 📊 Train classifiers on extracted PCAP features (packet metadata).
- ⚙️ Automate forensic analysis using intelligent detection.
- 🧪 Validate models using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.

## ⚙️ How to Use

### 🔧 1. Install Dependencies

Install all required libraries using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> ✅ Make sure you're using **Python 3.8+** and have a working environment for Scapy, TensorFlow, and Keras.

---

### 🧠 2. Train a Model

Train a model using one of the provided PCAP datasets:

```bash
python model/model_creator.py --train data/training1.pcap
```

You can substitute `training1.pcap` with any other file such as `training2.pcap`, `training3.pcap`, etc.

---

### 🔍 3. Run ARP Spoof Detection

Run detection on a test capture file:

```bash
python model/main.py --input data/poisoning_test.pcap
```

The model will output whether an ARP spoofing attempt is detected based on the PCAP input.

---

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

The model performance is evaluated using:

- ✔️ **Accuracy**
- 🎯 **Precision & Recall**
- 📈 **F1 Score**
- 📉 **Confusion Matrix**
- 🔍 **ROC Curve**

> These are printed during training and shown in logs when testing the model.
